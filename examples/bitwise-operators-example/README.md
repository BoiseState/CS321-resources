Bitwise Operators in Java
-------------------------


Demo bitwise operators in Java.  

Bitwise operators can be used with any integral number type such as byte, short, int, and long.

BitwiseOperatorsDemo.java --> Demos all the bitwise operators in Java

SequenceUtils.java --> Shows how to use encoding of DNA strings as long values
                         
The SequenceUtils.java example shows how to pack the bases in a DNA sequence into
a long (as binary number) and how to extract the DNA bases back out. This will result in around 8x savings in memory (and on disk as well).

See the javadocs for the examples for more information. Start browsing from docs/package-summary.html. Eclipse and IntelliJ will open web pages in HTML natively. For VS Code, you need to install the web browser plugin.

See [Java Bitwise Operators](https://www.baeldung.com/java-bitwise-operators) for a tutorial on bitwise operators in Java.
