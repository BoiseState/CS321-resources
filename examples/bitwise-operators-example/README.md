Bitwise Operators in Java
-------------------------


Demo bitwise operators in Java.  See [Java Bitwise Operators](https://www.baeldung.com/java-bitwise-operators) for a brief tutorial.

Bitwise operators can be used with any integral type such as byte, short, int, and long.

BitwiseOperatorsDemo --> Demos all the bitwise operators in Java

BitwiseShiftDemo.java --> Shows an extended example using bitwise operators and DNA sequences.
                         
The extended BitwiseShiftDemo.java example shows how to pack the bases in a DNA sequence into
a long and how to extract the bases back out. This will result in around 8x savings in memory
(and on disk as well).
