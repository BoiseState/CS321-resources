# Introduction

This simple example shows an abstract base class Mammal.java and two subclasses Cat.java and
Dog.java that extend Mammal.java. The Mammal.java class has protected instance variables that allow
the subclasses to access information. 

Finally, the MammalTest.java class is a driver that demonstrates the usage of the classes.

# Running the example

To run the example, go up one level and use

```
java simple_inheritance_example.MammalTest
```
 and the output should be
 
```
MammalTest: woof woof! I am Leo
MammamlTest: meow meow! I am Leela
MammalTest: woof woof! I am Leo
MammalTest: meow meow! I am Leela
```


# Note

Javadoc and other comments are intentionally skipped in this example to just present the basic
skeleton of a class hierarchy.
