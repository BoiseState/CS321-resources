# Introduction

This simple example shows an abstract base class Mammal.java and two subclasses Cat.java and
Dog.java that extend Mammal.java. The Mammal.java class has protected instance variables that allow
the subclasses to access information. 

Finally, the MammalTest.java class is a driver that demonstrates the usage of the classes.

# Note

Javadoc and other comments are intentionally skipped in this example to just present the basic
skeleton of a class hierarchy.
